    "2019-nCoV (武汉肺炎, pronounced Wǔhàn fèiyán) is a new coronavirus first found in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China.  A new protocol has been suggested for screening people arriving from the Hubei region. We want to use this test to quarantine probable cases to prevent the spread of nCoV and predict probability of death. People can either not have nCov or have nCov and our test can be positive or negative and the person can be dead or alive from the disease. Let's take the random variable $C$ to indicate if the patient has nCov, $T$ to indicate if the test is positive, and $S$ to be their state (alive = 1) after 7 days. On our first day of testing, 1200 people were tested and 200 had a positive test. Follow-up testing of those 200 showed that 11 had confirmed infections by nCov. We also, to ensure accuracy, did additional tests on the 1,000 who had a negative test result and found that one had nCov. Separately, we know that out of the 560 confirmed cases of nCov, 17 people died from the disease. Using this information, answer the following question:\n",
