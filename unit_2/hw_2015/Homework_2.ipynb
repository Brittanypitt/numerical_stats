      "Proteins are made up of amino acids in a polymer chain. The list of amino acids in that chain is called a protein sequence. There are 20 amino acids and thus 20 possibilities at each sequence position. By comparing sequences of proteins from different species, we can predict the evolutionary history of proteins and organisms based on sequence similarity. Furthermore, by seeing which parts of a protein sequence do not change, we can predict which specific amino acids are related to the function of a protein. In this problem, we will build two models of a protein representing two possible evolutionary histories. Model 1 will have important amino acids at positions 23, 24 and 25. Model 2 will have important amino acids at positions 24, 25 and 99. Although we will not do this now, we can use these two models to assign sequences to different lineages. \n",

If the position is important (23,24,25), in model 1 the probability of amino acids V, A, I, and L is equal and four times the probability of each other amino acid, which have equal probabilities. In model 2, if the position is 24 or 25, the same rule applies. If the position is 99 in model 2, the probability of D and E is equal and one hundred times the probability of each other amino acid, which again have equal probability. If a position is unimportant, all amino acids have equal probability. *Hint: Combine these algebraic statements ALONG with the normalization condition to get a probability mass function*\n",
