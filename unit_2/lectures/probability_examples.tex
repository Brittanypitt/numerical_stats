  \emph{The purpose of this document is to show you how English
    sentences represent probability equations}

  Consider the probability distribution
  \begin{equation}
    \Pr(X=x, Y=y, Z=z)
  \end{equation}

  with no assumptions of independence, the following is true

  \vspace{0.5cm}

  \begin{tabular}{lr}
    Sentence & Equation\\
    \hline\\
    What is the probability of $X=2$, $Y=2$, and $Z=0$? & $\Pr(X=2, Y=2, Z=0)$\\
    What is the probability of $X=1$, $Y=5$? & $\Pr(X=1, Y=2) = \sum_z\Pr(X=1, Y=2, Z=z)$\\
    If $Z=4$, what is the probability of $X=2$, $Y=4$? & $\Pcond{X=2, Y=4}{Z=4}$\\
    What is the probability of $X=2$, $Y=4$, given $Z$ is 4? & $\Pcond{X=2, Y=4}{Z=4}$\\
    If $Y=2$ and $Z = 0$, what is the probability of $X$? & $\Pcond{X=x}{Y=2, Z=0}$\\
