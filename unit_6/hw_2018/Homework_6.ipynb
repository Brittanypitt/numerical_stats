    "5. [2 points] Harry says that expected value is like an average, so you can compute two ways: $ E[X] = \\sum_i^N \\frac{x_i}{N} $ and the way we learned in class: $E[X] = \\sum_i P(x) \\cdot x$. Is Harry correct or is there an issue with his logic?\n",

For example, if $N = 3$ and $n = 1$, you could have $100$, $010$, and $001$. If $N = 10$, how many unique permutations are possible for all numbers of successes?

For example, `fill_between(x, 0, y)` will fill the area between 0 and `y`, where `y` could be a `numpy` array. Using `fill_between`, show the cumulative probability function for the exponential distribution from $t = 0$ to $t = 5$ with $\\lambda = 0.25$. Ensure that there are two lines on your plot: one that is the exponential pdf and one that is the `fill_between`. The pdf should extend further than your `fill_between` line. Add a vertical line at $t=5$. No legend necessary."
