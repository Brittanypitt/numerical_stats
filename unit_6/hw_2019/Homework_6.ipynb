      "1. We've seen two types of confidence intervals. One type is for predicting where the next sample will be in a known distribution and one type is for predicting where a true mean will be given some data. For the latter type, predicting the true mean, we saw how with many data points or if we know the true standard deviation we can use a normal distribution. When predicting the true mean with a few data points, the confidence interval for error in the mean follows a $t$-distribution. Thus there are three possible confidence interval problems. Write out and label an example problem that demonstrates each of the confidence intervals. Refer back to the example problems in Unit 6, Lecture 2. You only need to set-up your problems, not solve them.\n",
