Numerical Methods and Statistics
====

These are lecture notes and homeworks for a course taught at the
University of Rochester by Andrew White in the Chemical Engineering
Department. The course is taught using Jupyter Notebooks.

Course Descriptions
---

This course provides an introduction to numerical methods and
engineering statistics for chemical engineers. Students learn to use
computer models and statistics to understand engineering systems. The
focus of numerical methods is translating engineering problems into
nalgorithms and implementing them in a spreadsheet or programming
language. Topics covered include basic data structures, programming
flow control, plotting, function minimization, integration and
differential equations. The statistics portion teaches students basic
probability theory, the central limit theorem, hypothesis testing,
confidence intervals, regression, model fitting and basic error
analysis.
