Take $D = 0$ to indicate the fair die and $D = 1$ to indicate the unfair die. The unfair die has a probability of 90\\% of being chosen. The probability of a roll with the unfair die is $x / 21$, where $x$ is the value of the role. Answer the following questions symbolically. $X_i$ indicates the value of the roll on attempt $i$. The rolls are conditionally independent on the identity of the die. \n",
