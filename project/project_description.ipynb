    "The goal of the project is for you to work collaboratively on an open-ended complex problem using the numerical methods and statistics you've learned in the course and communicate your findings with a non-technical audience. You should develop reasonable assumptions to construct a numerical model for your topic of choice in Python. This can be built using chemical engineering principles and/or from data relevant to your topic. Each of the topics has an objective or question which should be answered with a reasoned argument supported by evidence from your model. In addition to a written report to me and your peers, you will create web-based deliverable whose target audience is the general public. You may choose to create a blog-style entry, a video, or some other creative medium for the web-based deliverable. "

    "Your final notebook report should consist of about 1500-2000 words with equations and plots. Your notebook will be ungraded if you have no equations or plots, unless discussed ahead of submission. The target audience here is for your peers and instructor. Your project will be graded according to the following rubric (see example grades below for point breakdown).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [25 Points] Your writing and notebook establishes a hypothesis and supports it with evidence. This portion of your grade evaluates your logical argument supporting the hypothesis and how you present your evidence to support it. If your project is about a design, your hypothesis could be that your design optimizes cost and size. If your project is about comparing a variety of proposals, your hypothesis could be that one is optimal. A logical argument means that your writing and figures all contribute towards supporting your hypothesis and you present your evidnce correctly. Your notebook should have a conclusion that summarizes your hypothesis and evidence. \n",

    "3. [15 Points] You correctly apply the methods we learned in class and correctly state what they do. Your equations are correct.\n",

See the library resource guide for a description of scholarly vs non-scholarly sources. Briefly, peer-reviewed articles apply *including* review articles. You may cite as many news or web sources as needed (non-scholarly). \n",

A non-technical reader should be able to read and understand the content in 10-15 minutes or 5 minutes if in video format. You should describe the problem you solved, its relevance to society, how you built your numerical model and its limitations, and your conclusions supported with evidence.
