    "The goal of the project is for you to work collaboratively on an open-ended complex problem using the numerical methods and statistics you've learned in the course and communicate your findings with a non-technical audience. You should develop reasonable assumptions to construct a numerical model for your topic of choice in Python. This can be built using chemical engineering principles and/or from data relevant to your topic. Each of the topics has an objective or question which should be answered with a reasoned argument supported by evidence from your model. In addition to a written report to me and your peers, you will create web-based deliverable whose target audience is the general public. You may choose to create a blog-style entry, a video, or some other creative medium for the web-based deliverable. "

A non-technical reader should be able to read and understand the content in 10-15 minutes or 5 minutes if in video format. You should describe the problem you solved, its relevance to society, how you built your numerical model and its limitations, and your conclusions supported with evidence.
